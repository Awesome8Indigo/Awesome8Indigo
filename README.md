## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm indigo, a student in howard county at BBMS. I like philosiphy, the arts, and learning new languages, and coding. I love coding a lot. Its fun and i get to express myself in new ways. Currently I am working on an indie game which i plan on selling, and a conjugation practicer for hebrew using python.
